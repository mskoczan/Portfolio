# About me

My name is Marcin Koczan, I have been working as a team leader at Amazon for 4 years, I have been in the ICQA department for 2 years (previously TL in the following departments: Customer Returns, Vendor Return, DOCK IN / OUT). Looking for a new way for further development, I started to be interested in testing and so I found the Manual Tester course, which I completed with a positive result. In order to deepen my knowledge and technical skills, in April 2022 I completed the Automation Tester course.

* What is testing for me - searching for the truth about a product

My goal is to further develop test knowledge and technical skills. at this point I would like to share mine
experience gained through personal study and research.
