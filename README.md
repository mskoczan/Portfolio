## About me

My name is Marcin Koczan, I have worked as a team leader in a corporation for over 4 years. I have spent the last 2 years in the ICQA quality department. Looking for a new path for further development, I started to be interested in manual testing and that's how I found the “Manual Tester” course, which I completed with a positive result. Testing kind of reminds me of developing and conducting audits to improve processes.

 **“What is testing for me – a constant search for the truth about the product”.** I like this sentence because I fully agree with it.

My goal is to further develop test knowledge and technical skills. Thanks to this look, in April 2022 I completed another course “Automation Tester”. After completing the courses, I got to know the tools and technologies listed below.
GitHub is the perfect place to share my experience through personal study and research.
Thank you for looking here.
